# data-cleaning-r

This is part of a workshop on Data Cleaning with R. The Tidyverse packages dplyr, tidyr, and readr are used.

The datasets 'CarPurchase.csv' and 'honeyraw_1998to2002' are cleaned and the resulting datasets are stored as 'Better_CarPurchase.csv' and 'Better_honey_1998.csv' respectively. Other datasets are added for practice.
